The use of web scraped data can significantly help **GIGI Studios** in different ways. By using factual data such as prices and discounts, it provides crucial information on the companys pricing strategy compared to its competitors. With this data, the company can identify any discrepancies in their prices and accordingly adjust their pricing model. In addition, if the data shows that competitors offer discounts regularly, usual business practices, or seasonal events, this can act as a guide for the company to initiate their own discount events to stay competitive.
